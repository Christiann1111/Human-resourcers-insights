# 📊 Attendance Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance data over a period of three months (April - June 2022) to gain actionable insights into presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave patterns. The data was cleaned and processed using **Power Query**, and a detailed analysis was conducted to create a comprehensive dashboard in **Power BI**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure employee presence rates.
- Track work-from-home (WFH) trends.
- Identify patterns in sick leaves (SL).
- Provide actionable insights for management to optimize attendance policies.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Power Query**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and validation.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
### 1. **Overall Metrics**
- **Presence Rate**: 91.83%
- **Work-from-Home (WFH) Rate**: 10.00%
- **Sick Leave (SL) Rate**: 1.10%
  
### 2. **Visual Insights**
- The dashboard includes three key trend charts:
  - **Presence % by Date**: Tracks daily presence over the selected months.
  - **WFH % by Date**: Displays fluctuations in remote work patterns.
  - **SL % by Date**: Highlights trends in sick leave over time.

- **Daily Breakdown**:
  - Highest presence rates are observed on **Mondays** (93.21%), while **Fridays** have the highest WFH rates (13.01%).
  - Sick leaves are more frequent at the start of the week, peaking on **Mondays** (1.62%).

### 3. **Employee Breakdown**
A table displays individual employee metrics:
- Presence %
- Work-from-Home %
- Sick Leave %

## 📅 Attendance Key
The dataset uses various attendance codes to represent different leave types:

| Code   | Description                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| **P**  | Present                               |
| **PL** | Paid Leave                            |
| **SL** | Sick Leave                            |
| **WFH**| Work From Home                        |
| **HPL**| Half Day Paid Leave                   |
| **FFL**| Floating Festival Leave               |
| **BL** | Birthday Leave                        |
| **LWP**| Leave Without Pay                     |

## 🛠️ How the Analysis Was Conducted
1. **Data Cleaning**: Leveraged Power Query to handle missing values, standardize attendance codes, and aggregate data.
2. **Data Analysis**: Focused on calculating key metrics like presence rates, WFH percentages, and identifying peak leave days.
3. **Visualization**: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for easy interpretation of trends.

## 📈 Key Findings & Recommendations
- The company maintains a high overall presence rate (91.83%), but WFH spikes on Fridays, suggesting employees prefer remote work towards the end of the week.
- The sick leave rate is low (1.10%), but management might want to explore the reasons behind the uptrend in SL rates.
- The employee presence is on a slight downtrend
- The work from home is on a slight uptrend
